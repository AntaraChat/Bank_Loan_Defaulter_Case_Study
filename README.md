# Business Problem:
This case study aims to give an idea of applying EDA in a real business scenario. This case study is intended to develop a basic understanding of risk analytics in banking and financial services and understand how data is used to minimise the risk of losing money while lending to customers.

This case study aims to identify patterns which indicate if a client has difficulty paying their installments which may be used for taking actions such as denying the loan, reducing the amount of loan, lending (to risky applicants) at a higher interest rate, etc. This will ensure that the consumers capable of repaying the loan are not rejected. Identification of such applicants using EDA is the aim of this case study.
In other words, the company wants to understand the driving factors (or driver variables) behind loan default, i.e. the variables which are strong indicators of default.  The company can utilise this knowledge for its portfolio and risk assessment.


                   
# Important Points to remember while solving the Assignment :
- The commands are syntactically correct.
- The output of the code is correct in terms of the question and format.
- The data frame has been thoroughly inspected using the taught commands.
- In the case of dataframes, the results contain the same rows and columns as expected
- Regarding plots, making appropriate charts with the mentioned libraries and getting the right trends.Writing clear and concise inferences for the charts wherever asked.
- The code is concise. Wherever appropriate, built-in functions are used instead of making the code longer (if-else statements, for loops,loc/iloc ).
- If new variables are created, the names are descriptive and unambiguous. Following the variable/dataframe names mentioned in the question wherever it is provided.
- Charts are neatly formatted including proper chart sizes, annotations(if required) and labelling.
- Mention the inferences for each of the graphs after thoroughly inspecting them.
